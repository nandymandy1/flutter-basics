/////////////NOTES/////////////////////////////


// Some widgets are stateful and some are stateless.
// If a user interacts with any widget, if it changes then it is stateful Widget
// A widgets's state onsistes of the values that can change, like a sidebar's current value or wheater a checkbox is checked.
// A widget's state is stored in a state object, seperating the widgets's state from its appearance
// When the widget's state changes, the state objct calls setState() method, tellin the framework to redraw the Widget


// Stateless widgets are those whose staes remains constant trhoughout the app cycle
// Statefull widget is dynamic and a user can interct with it
